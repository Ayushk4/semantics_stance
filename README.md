# SemStance

Can semantics help with stance detection?
The Dataset used is Will-they-wont-they dataset.

Please check the [`mh`](https://github.com/Ayushk4/semStance/tree/mh) branch for the multi-headed graph attention code for stance detection.

Please check the [`bert`](https://github.com/Ayushk4/semStance/tree/bert/) branch for semantic graph attention over BERT.

The semantic parser can be obtained from [coli-saar/am-parser](https://github.com/coli-saar/am-parser)

## Coming Soon!

- Instructions for training models
- Scripts for converting am-parser semantic graphs into data-loader format.
- Pre-trained models
